     The Three Laws

Asimovâ€™s Three Laws are as follows:

    - A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
    
    - A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
    
    - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
